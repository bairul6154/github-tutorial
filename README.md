## Git vs. GitHub

What is Git and Github?  
Git is a version-control system that runs on the command line (so you need to know basic command line codes as well).
Version-control means you can keep track of your code or just about any file. The basic workflow of git is creating a file
inside a directory and initialize it. This turns that directory into a repository, or repo for short. Then you can add files 
from your working directory to the staging area. The staging area is the step before a commit and it allows you to edit however you want.  

Github is the "cloud" or online in a website, that can store all your files and can let other people to see it or maybe even collaborate on it
In github, you can also see all the changes (commits) you've made to a repository. The basic workflow of github is either starting from someone
else's repository or your own repository. It is called github for a reason, so it does require git.  

If you don't understand some of these, don't worry you will after reading through this tutorial.
